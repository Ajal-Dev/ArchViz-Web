                Architectural visualization, commonly referred to as "archviz," is the practice of creating visual representations of architectural designs. These representations can range from simple sketches and drawings to highly detailed and photorealistic 3D models and animations. Archviz is used by architects, designers, real estate developers, and marketing teams to visualize buildings and interior spaces before they are constructed.
